When you will develop your application, you will have to face many difficulties.
The goal of this section is to provide enough entry point to be able to dive into JavaScript problems.

- When you want to find the documentation of a javascript object or function, you have to search : `mdn {functionName or ObjectName}`, Example: `mdn forEach` leads to this [site](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Objets_globaux/Array/forEach).
MDN stands for [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/) and really often the documentation is available in many languages.

- When you have to implement an algorithm sucha as filter, loop, extention you can use [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org)

- The [Backbone](backbonejs.org) documentation.

- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) documentation
