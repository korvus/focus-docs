Focus has an existing set of view.

## Hierarchy

![View Hierarchy]({{ site.url }}/{{site.baseurl}}/assets/view_behaviour_inheritance.png)

## Options

All views have an object in their instance called `this.opts`.
This object is a computation of all options declared in the view.
- The framework views have a property called `defaultOptions`.
- In your View you can add your own options in the property called `customOptions`.
- The object you give to your view when you instanciate it is an options object.
- The override process is `defaultOptions <- customOptions <-viewInstanceOptions `

{% highlight javascript %}
  //Create your own class of view
  var YourView = View.extend({
    // view default options
    customOptions: {
      myGreatOption: 7,
      myOtherOption: 14
    }
  }
  );
  //Creates an instance of your view
  var yourView = new YourView({myThirdOption: "niceOption", myOtherOption:21 });
  
  //Display your options
  console.log(yourView.opts);
  //Should display
  //{ myGreatOption: 7, myThirdOption: "niceOption", myOtherOption:21 }
{% endhighlight %}

When you have different behaviour for views, you can ajust options. A simple gist has been created in order to show you a set of possibilities.

## Reference Lists

In order to access a reference list in your view, you have to _ask_  for it in your view.
Each focus view have a property called `referenceNames` which should an array of **string** such as `referenceNames:['poles', 'locomotions']`.

- 1 : The view go through all its reference lists name and get the service to call from the referenceHelper.
- 2 : The view call each services which save their promises into an Array
- 3:  The view wait with a `Promise.all` for all services to have finished their loading and then save the references lists into a `references` property of the model and trigger a `references:loaded` event.

## Debug

Each view of **Focus** have a `debug` method. By default it logs :
- The model, the view, the template on each render (when the data are ready)
- The `DEBUG` function is not activated by default (the console would be too lousy), you have to activate it with `customOptions:{DEBUG: true}` 
- You can override the debug function during the realization of your page.
{% highlight javascript %}
var YourView = View.extend({
  customOptions:{
    DEBUG: true
  },
  debug: function yourViewDebug(){
    console.log('Hello this is my debug function');
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}
